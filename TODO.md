# TODO
- [ ] Android test (seems like a long step with Raylib Go, so maybe think of alternatives?). Maybe porting to C or Zig at this early stage would be good to be able to produce an Android game or a Web game?
- [x] User can drag and drop the letters
- [ ] Check for win conditions
- [ ] Find nice visuals and color palette
- [ ] Add Levels (N + 1 increase in board size)
- [ ] Establish a comprehensive dictionary of **clean** words
- [ ] Multiplayer??? P2P??? iroh??
- [ ] Music
- [ ] SFX

### Idea
- [ ] Helix/Hexagon board
- [ ] Infinite board - you get new set of letters once you run out of all letters and you can place them on the existing letters on the board. OR the board may extend depending on the situation. Or for every constructed word, we could clear those cells, and add new letters
