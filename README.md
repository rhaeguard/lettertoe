# lettertoe

3x3 grid, 9 letters. The first player that makes a word wins. Maybe it can continue after that till we run out of letters.

The grid does not have to be a 3x3 grid or a grid at all. It can be circular or helix or something like that.

The target for now is to maybe release as a mobile app.
